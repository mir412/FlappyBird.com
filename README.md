Flappy Bird is a browser-based game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where the player controls a bird that must fly between pipes by tapping or clicking to keep it afloat. The goal is to navigate through the pipes without colliding, with the game ending if the bird hits any pipe or the ground.
